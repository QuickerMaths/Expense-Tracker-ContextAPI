# Expense-Tracker-ContextAPI

This repo contains a simple expense tracker app written in React and TypeScript

## About application 

I've written this simple app to practice usage on ContexApi and useReducerHook. The app allows users to add, and delete transactions and save them in localStorage. 
The app also calculates the sum of all the transactions and categorizes them as income and expense. Additionally I've added a Doughnut chart from [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)
library, which displays income and expense values in green and red colors.

## How to start this app on your device 

```
# clone this repo 
git clone https://github.com/QuickerMaths/Expense-Tracker-ContextAPI

# install dependencies 
npm i

# start the local server 
npm run dev
```
