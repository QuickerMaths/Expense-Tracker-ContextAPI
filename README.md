# Expense-Tracker-ContextAPI

This repo contains simple expense tracker app written in React and TypeScript

## About application 

I've written this simple app to practice usage on ContexApi and useReducerHook. App allows user to add, delete transactions and saving them in localStorage. 
App also calculates sum of all the transactions, and categorize them as income and expense. Additionaly I've added Doughnut chart from [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)
library, which displays income and expense values in grenn and red colors.

## How to start this app on your device 

```
# clone this repo 
git clone https://github.com/QuickerMaths/Expense-Tracker-ContextAPI

# install dependencies 
npm i

# start the local server 
npm run dev
```
